# Autocorrection Using NLP
This code demonstrates how to perform autocorrection on a given text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It utilizes the autocorrect library and NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for tokenization.

## Prerequisites
Before running the code, make sure you have the following prerequisites set up:

Python 3: Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.

## Required Libraries:

autocorrect: To perform text autocorrection.
nltk: To tokenize the input text.
You can install these libraries using pip with the following command:
!pip install autocorrect nltk

## Usage

Clone the Notebook:
You can access the Jupyter Notebook containing the code by clicking on the following link: Open In Colab.

## Install Dependencies:
Run the first code cell to install the required libraries by executing the following code:
!pip install autocorrect
Download NLTK Data:

Run the second code cell to download the NLTK data required for tokenization:

import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')

Autocorrect Text:
In the third code cell, you can input a sentence or text that you want to autocorrect. Modify the a variable with your desired input.

Run the Autocorrection Code:
Execute the code cell containing the autocorrection logic by running it. The code will tokenize the input text and apply autocorrection using the autocorrect library.

View Autocorrected Output:
The corrected sentence will be displayed as the output of the code cell.

Example
Here's an example of autocorrection using this code:

## Input:
a = "Ntural Luanguage Processin deals with art of extracting insightes from Natureal Languaagge!"

## Output:
Natural Language Processing deals with the art of extracting insights from Natural Language!
